  "description": "The IPv4 Record Route (RR) Option instructs routers to record their IP addresses in a packet. RR is subject to a nine hop limit and, traditionally, inconsistent support from routers. Recent changes in interdomain connectivity—the so-called \"flattening Internet\"—and new best practices for how routers should handle RR packets suggest that now is a good time to reassess the potential of the RR Option.",
