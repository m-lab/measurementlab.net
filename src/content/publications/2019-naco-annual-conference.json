  "description": "M-Lab Community Lead, Chris Ritzo, provided an overview of M-Lab to NACo’s Rural Action Caucus (RAC). NACo's “TestIT” app that integrates M-Lab's NDT test was of specific interest as the national association of county elected officials explores the connection between national broadband data and federal funding. RAC members also had the opportunity to ask questions of NACo's developer of the TestIT App, learn how to access and analyze the data being collected.",
