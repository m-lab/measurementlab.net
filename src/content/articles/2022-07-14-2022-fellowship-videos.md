Recordings of the 2022 M-Lab Fellowship Presentations and Reports. 

In December 2021 M-Lab opened a call for M-Lab Fellows to use our data and tools for Internet Research. We selected them for the merit, rigor, and feasibility of their proposed project as well as their research’s relevance to improvement for end-user Internet performance. Here are the recordings of their final presentations given on July 6, 2022 and final reports that summarize their research.
